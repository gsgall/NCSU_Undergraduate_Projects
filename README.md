# NCSU Projects and Code
This repository is a collection of the projects and other misc. computational work completed during the completion of my major in Nuclear Engineering and minor in Computer Programming. 
# Courses Featured
- CSC 217: Software Development Fundamentals Lab (Java)
  - Lab Work: A course registration system.
- CSC 230: C and Software Tools (C) 
  - Project 1: Shows the increasing accuracy of taylor series approximations as higher order terms are added to calculate the value of trig functions. Project also includes formatting of given text in a box of *'s 
  - Project 2: Interprets and evaluates basic algebraic expressions in base 10 and base 25.
  - Project 3: The game Wordle.
  - Project 4: A data base of employees, their skills and availability.
  - Project 5: Program for encoding and decoding txt files using bitwise operations.
  - Project 6: Implementation of a Hash Map with String Keys and Integer Values 
- CSC 316: Data Structures and Algorithms (Java)
  - Course Work: Implementations of various data structures and algorithms. 
  - Project: A trail manager designed to find all possible paths from a given starting location and the distance from the start location and then end location. Also includes a performance study based on changing the implementation of the data structures that are used. 
- NE 301: Fundamentals of Nuclear Engineering (MATLAB)
  - Project 1: Numeric solution to decay equations for an arbitrary decay chain.
  - Project 2: Monte Carlo simulation to determine the mean path of a neutron from a point source. 
- NE 401: Reactor Analysis and Design (MATLAB)
  - The project is a numeric solution of the multi-group diffusion equation in 1D slab geometry with the objective of calculating the multiplaction factor and fundamental mode of the neutron flux. 
- NE 400/500: Reactor Energy Conservation (MATLAB) 
  - This project is a parametric study of the temperature distribution of a hollow spherical fuel pellet.
- NE 502 Reactor Engineering (python)
  - UNDER DEVELOPMENT 
  - This project determines core pressure drop to ensure theraml limits and critical power ratio.
