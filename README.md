# NCSU Projects and Code
This repository is a collection of the projects and other misc. computational work completed during the completion of my major in Nuclear Engineering and minor in Computer Programming. 
# Courses Featured
- NE 301: Fundamentals of Nuclear Engineering
  - Project 1: Numeric solution to decay equations for an arbitrary decay chain.
  - Project 2: Monte Carlo simulation to determine the mean path of a neutron from a point source. 
- NE 401: Reactor Analysis and Design 
  - The project is a numeric solution of the multi-group diffusion equation in 1D slab geometry with the objective of calculating the multiplaction factor and fundamental mode of the neutron flux. 
- NE 500: Reactor Energy Conservation
  - This project is a parametric study of the temperature distribution of a hollow spherical fuel pellet
